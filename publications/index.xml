      <description>Abstract: Appropriate planning and optimization strategies for day-ahead power management play important roles in efficient operation of Microgrids (MGs). Due to the uncertainties in electricity demand and renewable generations, and the multi-objective (MO) nature of MG power management, conventional optimization techniques have not been as effective in giving satisfactory results. This paper aims at solving the day-ahead power management problem as a MO optimization problem, with a focus on increasing the systemâ€™s resiliency using an agent-based Dynamic Programming (DP) approach named Value Iteration (VI) and a model-free Q-learning (QL) algorithm.</description>

      <description>Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent line congestion prognosis scheme based on wide-area measurements, which accurately identifies an impending congestion and the problem causing the congestion. Due to the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources and uncertainty of load/generation patterns in the Active Distribution Networks (ADNs), power line congestion is one of the issues that could happen during peak load conditions or high-power injection by renewable energy resources. Congestion would have devastating effects on both the economical and technical operation of the grid.</description>
