      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>F. N. Shimim, M. Alali, M. H. Nehrir, J. W. Sheppard, M. Bahramipanah, Z. Shahooei. Resiliency-Aware Power Management of Microgrids using Agent-based Dynamic Programming and Q-learning</title>

      <description>Abstract: Appropriate planning and optimization strategies for day-ahead power management play important roles in efficient operation of Microgrids (MGs). Due to the uncertainties in electricity demand and renewable generations, and the multi-objective (MO) nature of MG power management, conventional optimization techniques have not been as effective in giving satisfactory results. This paper aims at solving the day-ahead power management problem as a MO optimization problem, with a focus on increasing the system’s resiliency using an agent-based Dynamic Programming (DP) approach named Value Iteration (VI) and a model-free Q-learning (QL) algorithm.</description>

      <title>M. Alali, F. N. Shimim, Z. Shahooei, M. Bahramipanah. Intelligent Line Congestion Prognosis in Active Distribution System Using Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://imagine-sth.github.io/publications/mdps/</link>

      <description>Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent line congestion prognosis scheme based on wide-area measurements, which accurately identifies an impending congestion and the problem causing the congestion. Due to the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources and uncertainty of load/generation patterns in the Active Distribution Networks (ADNs), power line congestion is one of the issues that could happen during peak load conditions or high-power injection by renewable energy resources. Congestion would have devastating effects on both the economical and technical operation of the grid.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://imagine-sth.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>While adding Structured Data to a client&amp;rsquo;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid. Simple contribution to cleanup the user documentation providing syntactically valid JSON documents.</description>

      <description>BOSH (Bosh Outer SHell) &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;is an open source tool for release engineering, deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.&amp;rdquo; And it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly powerful. This examples uses BOSH to provision an Alassian vendor app running on JDK along with the support Postgres database and agents to support it. The releases manages the health of services and will automatically provision, start/stop processes across the various services.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>
      <link>https://imagine-sth.github.io/blog/force-ssl/</link>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
